Payload Dropping Mechanism (PDM) Arduino based scheme for semi-automated payload dropping UAV
# UAV Payload Dropping Mechanism (PDM) - Arduino Program

This repository contains the Arduino programs for a UAV Payload Dropping Mechanism (PDM). The PDM is designed to be used with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to facilitate controlled payload releases during flights.

## Installation Instructions

1. Ensure you have the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. If not, you can download it from the official Arduino website (https://www.arduino.cc).

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.

4. Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to the downloaded repository folder.

5. Open the Arduino sketch file (`.ino`) that corresponds to your specific UAV payload dropping mechanism setup.

6. Verify and compile the code in the Arduino IDE.

7. Upload the compiled code to your Arduino board. It is reccomended to verify the pin used in the code must be the same as used in the board.
